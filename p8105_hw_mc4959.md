## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns. Observations are the
level of items in orders by user. There are user / order variables –
user ID, order ID, order day and order hour. There are also item
variables – name, aisle, department and some numeric codes.

##### How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609

##### Make a table. Show the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week.

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
